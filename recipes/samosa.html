    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nobody can resist these perfect pyramids of flaky pastry, stuffed with a delicious spiced potato filling! But not all samosas are created equal. Too dry, not enough filling, bad pastry, weak spicing….. So I set out to make my own, and am proud to now share with you my very own Samosa recipe – my idea of the perfect Samosa!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ghee or canola oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cold water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>5 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh or frozen peas, thawed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh gingerroot</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Optional: Fennel seeds, crushed coriander seeds, caraway seeds or amchur (dried mango powder)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, ghee, salt and caraway seeds until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Gradually stir in enough water to form a firm dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until just tender, 8-10 minutes; drain. Set aside to cool slightly. In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add potatoes and cook until potatoes start to cling to the skillet, about 5 minutes. Stir in peas, ginger, garam masala, cumin seeds and salt; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in optional ingredients as desired. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll 1 piece of dough into a 10x6-in. oval. Cut dough in half. Moisten straight edge with water. Bring 1 corner of half moon up to meet the other corner of half moon, forming a cone. Pinch seam to seal. Fill with 3-4 tablespoons potato mixture. Moisten curved edge of dough with water; fold over top of filling and press seam to seal. Gently press the bottom of each samosa to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 350°. Brush the samosas with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil. In batches, arrange in a single layer, without touching, on tray in air-fryer basket. Cook until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
